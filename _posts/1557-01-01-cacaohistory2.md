Cacao was an early cash crop for the colonial spaniards in the late 1500 into the 1600s. However, many Spanish were leaving Nicaragua as the empire was more interested in exploiting the richer lands in Mexico and Peru.  In addition, from 1528 to 1540, most of the indigenous Nicaraguans (Nicarao), an estimated 200,000 (Merrill, 1993), were exported as slaves to South America, specifically Peru, to work in the mines there.  Spanish settlement of Nicaragua contracted to Le贸n and Granada, both cities on the shores of the two great lakes of Nicaragua.  When a large earthquake destroyed Le贸n (called Old Le贸n, the ruins of which are along Lake Managua) in 1610, many inhabitants moved to Granada, though Le贸n was also rebuilt later many miles to the West of its original location.

These two forces caused the decline of cacao by the end of the 1600s, as the Spanish lacked the knowledge and expertise to renew their plantations and increased competition from other Spanish colonilies reduced its profitability.  Though cacao had been grown for several hundred years by the indigenous people of Nicaragua, it declined rapidly along with the indigenous people who grew it.

Despite that, into the early 1900s, Nicaragua was known for producing one of the finest forms of cacao, called *Criollo*. Unfortunately the genetics of this variety of cacao were thought to be almost entirely wiped out by disease in the late 1940s and early 1950s (Millon, 1955). The surviving *Forastero* variety of cacao was less prized, and the majority of cacao was thus not exported, but consumed domestically.

Even through the turn of the century and into the 2000's, cacao in Nicaragua was a minor agricultural player, not garnering a mention in the country profile (Merrill, 1993).  Instead, coffee, an imported product, became the defining agricultural food crop of the country, reshaping and radically transforming the economy, society, and culture of the country. While an indigenous drink pinolillo (also called *tiste*), a drink of cacao, corn, and spices, is still seen as the official drink of Nicaragua, most Nicaraguans are now more likely to drink coffee, or increasingly a soda. There is nevertheless a certain irony that cacao is now seen as a savior crop for Nicaragua, as climate change decimates much of the traditional Nicaraguan shade-grown coffee.
