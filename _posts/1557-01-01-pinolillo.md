Pinolillo, also called tiste, is a traditional corn and cacao drink in Nicaragua.  The drink is intimately connected to Nicaraguan identity, as Nicaraguans call themselves Pinoleros.  Though pinol is used as a shorthard for pinolillo, it can also refer simply to corn meal, and thus the identification of Nicaraguans as Pinoleros may also be as much a statement of allegience to corn as it is to cacao.  Nevertheless, as Millon (1955) writes:
> Cacao is one of the principal foods of Nicaragua.  Almost the entire population uses it daily, either as chocolate or as "tiste," the popular national drink, a mixture of ground corn, cacao, sugar and water.  It is estimated that a family of six consumes an average of 200 mixings of "tiste" per month.  Each mixing contains one or two cacao seeds, sometimes three.

Though coffee overtook cacao as a central driving crop in the agricultural economy of Nicaragua, and ready made sodas and other bottle beverages have also gained popularity, the centrality of pinolillo to Nicaragua is still evident in consumption patterns across the country. A living wage report from 2019 described drinking pinolillo five times a week as sufficiently normative  to be included as part of the final model Nicaraguan diet used in the study, and estimated that participants were consuming an estimated 27 grams per person per day of pinolillo (Anders, Anker, and Anker, 2019).

#### Pinolillo/Tiste
* 1 Part Cacao seeds (also called beans)
* 1 Part Corn (kernals or meal)
* Cloves, Cinammon, and Allspice to taste

To make pinolillo or tiste, start with equal parts meal corn kernals and cacao seeds.  Toast each--the cacao will start to crackle, at which point you know it's done.  Don't burn either.  Mill both into fine powder, mixing in some cinammon, cloves, and allspice to taste.  Take about a cup of this mix and add just enough water to create a thick paste that can be formed into a little ball.

If you don't have a mill (most Nicaraguan markets have a communal mill one can pay to use), use prepared corn meal and toast then grind the cacao in a blender along with the corn meal, spices, and only enough water to make the blender work. What you want at the end is a little ball of paste.

Take the ball of paste and put it in a pitcher.  Mixing with a wooden spoon, add water slowly so that the paste gets thinner and thinner until it is thin enough to form a milky beverage.  Serve over ice, preferably in a hollow jicaro gourd, and drink through a straw, stirring continually to prevent all the corn from separating out at the bottom.

Some people add a touch of vanilla to pinolillo or tiste.  While also a crop native to Mesoamerica, Vanilla production is almost non-existent in Nicaragua and thus imported, causing it to be expensive. As a result, it's not tupically featured in Nicaraguan cuisine, and when it is, is artificial.
