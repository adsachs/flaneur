Much has been made about the use of cacao beans, really seeds, as a form of currency by the indigenous people's of Meso-American prior to and during the colonization.  As Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés wrote in one of the earliest colonial historical records of Mesoamerica, *The General History of the Indies*
> everything is bought with cacao, however expensive or cheap, such as gold, slaves, clothing, things to eat and everything else .... There are public women . . . who yield themselves to whomever they like for ten cacao beans . . . which is their money.
(translated in [Bergmann, 1968](10.1111/j.1467-8306.1969.tb00659.x))

Yet, as Bergmann (1968) notes, cacao production in Nicaragua was not wide-spread and did not seem to be heavily traded or commercialized, begging the question, if it was money that literaly "grew on trees," why didn't each family have a tree growing outside their dwelling? (See Cacao in Pre-Colombian History)
