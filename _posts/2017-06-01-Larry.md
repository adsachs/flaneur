In this Real Food Story, part of the Historias de Cacao/Chocolate Stories project, Larry "Asangpas" Salomon talks about the struggles of the Auas Tingni community of Mayangna, an indigenous people of Nicaragua, who are fighting to preserve their traditional lands and way of life. See Awas Tingni v. Nicaragua for their Inter-American Court of Human Rights case against Nicaragua.

Cacao is not a part of traditional Mayanga culture, despite the plant being native to Meso-America. Even after winning their case in the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the Awas Tingni Mayangna have been losing their lands as "colonists" of Spanish decent from the Pacific coast migrate to illegally settle demarcated Mayangna land. Mayangna culture traditionally relies on hunting, gathering, and fishing, using the forest for food, medicine, and other materials. One recent attempt to fight against the loss of their traditional lands and livelihoods has been the planting of shade grown cacao within their forests as a way to "develop" the land while also keeping it close to its natural state. By claiming the land in ways recognized by societies based on conventional notions of private property, then hope to strengthen their ability to resist encroachment on their lands while still retaining some level of their traditional culture.
