According to [Bergmann (1968)](https://www-tandfonline-com.stmarys-ca.idm.oclc.org/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8306.1969.tb00659.x), it appears that cacao in pre-Colombian Nicaragua was primarily grown by the indigenous peoples in the Pacific region of the country, including "some minor cultivation in the districts of (Old) León and Granada" according to the 1548-1551 *Tasación* (p95).  While there are accounts, from López de Velasco, that cacao was also gathered at the head of the San Juan River on the eastern shore of Lake Cocibolca (what was previously known as Lake Nicaragua), Bergmann believes this was most likely harvested from wild trees in the forests there rather than the product of human cultivation. According to him, "The significant areas of cultivation in Nicaragua in aboriginal times remained those near Leon and Granada" (p95). 

[Larry's story](https://adsachs.github.io/flaneur/#/article/2017-06-09-larry) of the recent effort of the Mayangna to use cacao as a way to claim their ancestral forests from the invasion of "colonists" who are cutting down trees to farm provides a point of comparison. Though the Mayangna were traditionally hunter-gatherers, relying on the rainforest for food, medicine, and clothing, moving through the North-Central and North-Eastern part of Nicaragua (including land that is now in Honduras) prior to the arrival of the Spanish.

According the Bergmann, Oviedo claims in *The General History of the Indies* that it was the Nicarao people who most likely introduced cacao to Nicaragua. The Nicarao were a Nahuat-speaking indigenous group who moved down to Nicaragua from what is now Mexico around 1200 AD with the collapse of the Mayan and Toltec civilizations and the large cities like Teotihuacan [(Fowler, 1985)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/482092?seq=1). The Nicarao people seemed to be the primary cultivators of cacao, though did so only for their only use rather than for trade. This was in contrast to other indigenous groups already in Nicaragua, such as the Chorotegans. Bergmann translates Oveido (Vl IV p61) as follows:
>  "...those that are called and are of the Nicaragua tongue are an immigrant people, they (from wherever they may have come) are the ones who brought to the land cacao, or the almonds that circulate as money in those parts; and those people own the plantings of trees that bear that fruit, and the Chorotegans do not own a single tree of it."

Bergmann further notes that there were no indigenous forms of measuring cacao--it was all recorded using Spanish measuring systems--and sees this as proof that cacao was not a commercial crop in Pre-Conquest Nicaragua (p95), depsite it also being claimed as a currency (see Cacao as Currency). Despite this lack of wide-spread pre-Colombian use, it has remained a sufficiently strong part of Nicaraguan culture in the years since to have come to be associated with Nicaraguan identity itself: Nicaraguan's call themselves *pinoleros* in reference to the traditional corn and cacao drink *pinolillo*.
