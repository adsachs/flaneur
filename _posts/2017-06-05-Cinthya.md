El Castillo del Cacao was one of the first local factories producing chocolate bars and other cacao products for the Nicaraguan consumer market.  The factory operates irregularly, as demand has not been sufficient for daily production, however El Castillo del Cacao also operates tours and an on-site shop to attract Nicaraguan and foreign tourists.
