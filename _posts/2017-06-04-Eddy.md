Eddy "El Norteño" Kühl and his wife Mausi Hayn are the founders of [Selva Negra](http://www.selvanegra.com/en/), an Ecolodge, integrated farm enterprise based on coffee, and sustainable community outside Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Eddy and Mausi are both decendents of some of the early German immigrants who settled Northern Nicaragua and helped bring coffee production to the region.  You can see the German infuence not only in name of the lodge, which translates in English as Black Forest, but also the architecture of parts of the ecolodge, remiscient of Bavaria, and their in house production of sausages and cheeses.
