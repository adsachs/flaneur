There are not many records of pre-Colombian indigenous culture in Nicaragua, nor of the conquest from an indigenous perspective [(Fowler, 1985)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/482092). What we mostly have are the writings of a few Europeans engaged in the exploration and colonization of Nicaragua. One interesting history of Nicaragua comes via Francis Augustus MacNutt's translation of the Italian historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, who was employed by the Spanish to chronicle the Age of Exploration and conquest of the "New World." In his *Eight Decades*, d'Anghiera recounts the exploits of various Spanish Conquistadores in Central and South America. In his *Sixth Decade* d'Anghiera takes a slight detour to recount the observations of Andres de Cereceda, the expedition treasurer of Conquistador Gil González Dávila, who met with the chief of the Nicarao people, called Nicaragua (for whom the county is named) in the town of Nicaraocali, what is now Rivas.  De Cereceda describes the meeting of González with several indigenous chiefs, including Nicaragua, and convinced them to convert to Catholicism. De Cereceda also records his observations of some aspects of indignenous religion and culture, though cacao is not specifically mentioned:
