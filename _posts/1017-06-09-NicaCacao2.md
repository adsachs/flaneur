An interesting historian of Nicaragua comes via Francis Augustus MacNutt's translation of the Italian historian Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, who was employed by the Spanish to chronicle the Age of Exploration and conquest of the "New World." In his *Eight Decades*, d'Anghiera recounts the exploits of various Spanish Conquistadores in Central and South America. In his *Sixth Decade* d'Anghiera takes a slight detour to recount the observations of Andres de Cereceda, the expedition treasurer of Conquistador Gil González Dávila.
