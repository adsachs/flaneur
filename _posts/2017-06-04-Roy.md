In this Real Food Story, part of the Historias de Cacao/Chocolate Stories project, Roy W. Martinez talks about his motivation for growing cacao as part of La Hammonia Farm (Finca La Hammonia), the farm business attached to his wife's family business, Selva Negra.

Roy, a Cuban-American Chef from Miami, Florida, moved to Nicaragua in 1998 to help his in-laws with Selva Negra.  The La Hammonia was already producing milk, eggs, and other products directly for consumption at Selva Negra's ecolodge, and Roy decided to add cacao to the farm so that the signature desserts served at the hotel could include home-grown chocolate.
