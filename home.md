title: "Real Food Stories"
---

Everybody eats, most of us every day, often more than once. Food, no matter who you are, is an everyday part of your life. The old adage, “you are what you eat,” is not simply a statement of biological reality, but one of identity and culture; We create our “selves” out of the cultural milieu that food provides us. We might paraphrase French gourmand [Brillat-Savarin’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Anthelme_Brillat-Savarin) for this project as, “the food you eat tells a story about who you are.” The stories we tell about our foods also speak to who we are.

**Real Food Stories** is a “born-digital” documentary project that harnesses the multimedia capabilities of the web to map stories about food so users can explore and understand the importance that food stories hold for cultural, individual, and collective meaning-making. Our prototype, **Historias de Cacao/Cacao Stories**, is a collection of interviews with stakeholders from across the Nicaraguan cacao and chocolate industry, and serves as the basis for expanding the project to other regions and foods.
